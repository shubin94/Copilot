Project Overview:
Build a private detectives web portal similar in design and user experience to Fiverr, with three distinct user logins (Super Admin, Subscriber/Detective, and Customer/User) and a publicly accessible frontend.

Mandatory Development Principles:

Design files must be completely separated from backend code to ensure UI changes do not affect functionality.

Backend architecture must be robust, secure, and scalable to handle millions of records efficiently.

All data must be stored securely in a database; no data should be stored in browser local storage or caches.

Each page or feature should be developed and maintained as a separate file or component for easy editing and modular updates.

Security best practices must be followed to protect data, authentication, and authorization at all layers.

User Roles & Features:

1. Super Admin Portal:

Sidebar navigation layout.

Dashboard with real-time analytical widgets and charts for metrics such as total detectives (active/suspended/deleted), new signups (pending approval), subscription plans usage, and revenue trends.

Manage New Signups: list pending detective applications, detailed inspection with document viewing, approve/reject with automatic notification emails to detectives.

Approved Detectives List: searchable/filterable with quick suspend/reactivate/delete options. Suspension requires mandatory reason visible on profile, with email alert.

Individual Detective Profiles: editable details, uploaded document management, subscription plan overview, reviews moderation.

Subscription Management: create/edit/delete plans, flexible pricing (monthly/yearly/custom), assign benefits such as verified badge, contact options.

Homepage Slider Management: upload, edit, activate/deactivate slider content dynamically.

2. Detective (Subscriber) Portal:

Multi-step signup including personal/business details, document uploads, services selection with pricing ranges.

Dashboard/Profile: edit permitted fields, reply to reviews, view subscription details, and self-manage subscription upgrades or downgrades.

Contact methods on profile change dynamically per subscription level (free plan: email only; paid plans: phone, WhatsApp, and verified badge).

3. User (Customer) Frontend:

Fiverr-like interface for searching and filtering private detectives by services, location, verification, reviews, subscription status.

Detailed detective profile pages with company info, services, pricing, and contact options shown according to subscription.

Contact limited to WhatsApp, phone, and email; no payment or booking via platform.

Additional Requirements:

Automated emails for signup approval, account suspension, subscription expiry, and review replies.

Reviews can only be posted by logged-in users and moderated by the super admin.

Admin has full control to manage subscription plans and dynamic service categories anytime.

UI/UX for all portals must strictly follow Fiverr’s layout and style, including internal dashboards and pages.

All pages and components must be separately maintained for clarity and modularity.

Suggested Tech Stack (optional to propose to AI):

Backend: Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/Django for scalability.

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for secure, scalable data storage.

Frontend: React/Vue with component-based architecture.

Email: SMTP for automated notifications.

Guidance for Development Workflow:

Start by scaffolding the project with separated design and backend folders.

Implement authentication modules first for all user roles.

Develop Super Admin features in incremental checkpoints, starting from Dashboard, Signup management, Detective profiles, and Subscription controls.

Parallelly initiate Subscriber signup and profile modules.

Build the public frontend interface last, focused on search and profile views.

Use version control check-ins after completing each logical module for safe rollback and iterative refinement.
